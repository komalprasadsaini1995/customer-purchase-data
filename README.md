This project involves analyzing customer purchase data to extract meaningful insights that can help businesses understand buying behavior, segment customers, and improve decision-making. Using Python, the data is cleaned, explored, and visualized to identify patterns such as top-selling products, customer lifetime value, seasonal trends, and purchase frequency. The project may also include predictive modeling to forecast future sales or recommend products based on customer history.
Key Tasks:
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn

Customer segmentation using clustering (e.g., K-Means)

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis

Sales trend and behavior forecasting with machine learning (optional)

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn (for clustering or predictive modeling)

Jupyter Notebook or any IDE
